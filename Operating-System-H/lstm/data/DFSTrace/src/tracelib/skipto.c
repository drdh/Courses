 *  skipover and skipto -- skip over characters in string
 *
 *  Usage:	p = skipto (string,charset);
 *		p = skipover (string,charset);
 *
 *  char *p,*charset,*string;
 *
 *  Skipto returns a pointer to the first character in string which
 *  is in the string charset; it "skips until" a character in charset.
 *  Skipover returns a pointer to the first character in string which
 *  is not in the string charset; it "skips over" characters in charset.

 *	Skipover, skipto rewritten to avoid inner loop at expense of space.
 *
 * 20-Nov-79  Steven Shafer (sas) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Skipover, skipto adapted for VAX from skip() and skipx() on the PDP-11
 *	(from Ken Greer).  The names are more mnemonic.
 *
 *	Sindex adapted for VAX from indexs() on the PDP-11 (thanx to Ralph
 *	Guggenheim).  The name has changed to be more like the index()
 *	and rindex() functions from Bell Labs; the return value (pointer
 *	rather than integer) has changed partly for the same reason,
 *	and partly due to popular usage of this function.
